# competitive-programming
This repository includes my solutions to various competitive programming problems derived from sources such as past Canadian Computing Competition and ECOO problem sets, Codeforces, CSES, and independent Java exercises.

Many of the solutions are in the Java programming language because that was the first language I learned for competitive programming. However, note that I have recently switched to using solely C++ for competitive programming, as reflected primarily in the Codeforces and CSES solutions.
